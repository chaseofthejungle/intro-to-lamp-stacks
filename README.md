# Intro to Lamp Stacks Overview Guide

**TODO:** A brief introductory guide to LAMP stacks for open source web apps.

## 1. What is a LAMP Stack?

LAMP stacks are integrated suites of technologies for gosting dynamic websites and web apps. In short, they are bundles of four core open-source software components:

1) **Linux** (providing an Operating System, as a fountain).
2) **Apache** (as a web server, handling incoming data requests and serving up web page data).
3) **MySQL** (for database purposes, storing and keeping web asset data organized)
4) A **scripting language** (such as Python, PHP, or Perl... all beginning with 'P', hence the 'P' in 'LAMP'... to process server-side code and generate the dynamic content that will be sent back to the client--that is to say, a user's web browser).
